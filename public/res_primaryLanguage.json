    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ryan Papsin. I am a newly graduated full-stack software developer with a specialty in Java.I served in the US Army for over 11 years and retired as a Sergeant First Class. In the military, I was able to learn how to be part of a team and manage a team. Every task that I was givenhell had two things in common; overcoming obstacles, whether that be physical or mental, and problem-solving.I most recently worked as a barber for three years and won a Barber Battle in 2021. Before leaving due to medical reasons I had a full cliental schedule. In barbering, I learned how to apply my problem-solving skills and creativity to a new line of work.I hope to bring what I've learned from the military and barbering and apply it to software development.I'm extremely fascinated with coding and eager to start work.I am seeking a full-time software developer position.I'd love to be an asset to your team.Thank you.",
